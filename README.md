# Credit-Card-Transaction-Fraud-Detection

This project is collaborated with Sih-Yu Hunag, ChinKai Huang, and Yi-Chin Lin.


The goal is to detect fraudulent activities based on credit card transaction data, unveiling and combating the increasingly sophisticated fraud.
The pipline we will go through including data preprocessing, feature engineering, feature selection, building baseline models, non-linear models and implementing models.

We built 10 different supervised models in total to explore and compare the performance. Ideally, our final model (Neural Network) could help eliminate 60.28% of the fraud by declining 3% of the transactions and, for a score cutoff at 4%, we could save about $1.25 million annually.
